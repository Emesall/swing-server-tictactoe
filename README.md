Simple TicTacToe game beetwen two users connected to the server, written in Java. 
In the project were used Socket, Thread, Swing functionalities.

The application is divided into two sections: Client and Server. 
-Client is basically based on GUI. No logic at all here.
-Server communicates with clients, gets informations and responds to them.

Communication is based on sending string: prefixes+data. 
You can find specification in Communication.txt.



Application created in order to learn more about programming in Java. 
App was ONLY tested in a localhost so there will be probably some client<->server issues once it's deployed.
